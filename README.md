This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Tic Tac Toe

This is only frontend app. It is a simple game, created to showcase the work. 
1. Didn't used redux as it was a very simple task.
2. Used create react app for initial setup. As it was convenient and less time consuming.  
3. Not saving any game data. I did not used any frond end methods to save data in my previous experience, hence didn't wanted to try new thing in this task.

## Done
- [x] Created a decent UI   
- [x] Wrote test  

## Improvements

- [ ] Include type checking   
- [ ] Save game data

## Commands to run the project

- local: npm run start
- test: npm run test
- production build: npm run build
